## üß© Development Approach

This project leverages Next.js's modern `app` directory structure for flexible and scalable routing. The source code is organized as follows:

- **`src/app`**: Main pages and layouts, including dynamic routes for individual bookings (`src/app/bookings/[id]`).  
- **`src/components`**: Reusable UI components like `BookingTable`, `StatsSection`, and `Sidebar`.  
- **`public`**: Static assets, including `bookings.json` which serves as the data source.

Booking data is loaded from the JSON file and displayed in a user-friendly table. Styling combines global CSS with component-level styles to ensure a polished and responsive interface.

Next.js features such as automatic font optimization, server-side rendering, and dynamic routing are utilized to deliver a fast, SEO-friendly experience.

- Integrating a backend API for real-time booking data  
- Adding authentication and user roles
